# Necessary rewrite

Initially, the Partner Hub was released in 2015, allowing Starbucks employees to access their schedule from home. This program was initially a script to just get me to the landing page and I would do the inputting myself. After a short while, this became tedious and I further introduced more functionality to the script. The biggest hurdle was timing, as it was tricky to know when the landing page had fully loaded. I also had a drop down menu which presented another issue where the script was too quick for webpage. The schedule page was actually the easiest part of the whole endeavour, as the date and time were **logically** placed next to each other. You will soon understand my frustration later.
