Finding legitimately good information on Google can be difficult. This is a list of resources that have helped me better understand Unix and various different programming languages.

# YouTube

## Luke Smith

This YouTube channel is dedicated solely on the utmost efficiency in the command prompt. I find some of his optimizations to be too much for me including the use of a tiling window manager (i3 gaps) and omitting the use of some keys on the keyboard. I however have pulled some great inspiration from this channel, including my migration to vim as a fully fledged IDE and switching to a different terminal emulator (urxvt). Please be advised that he uses some interesting thumbnails and titles. The content is there, you just need to sift through it.

## Joshua Fluke

Josh runs a channel on the hustle to get what you want aspect. His channel is much less focused on "what should I be doing with my coding knowledge" and more about how can you get your foot in the door and prove yourself. He also goes over the need to have multiple sources of income to help combat needing to rely on one entity to provide for you. He has inspired me to write this blog actually and to be more outgoing in regards to my career.
